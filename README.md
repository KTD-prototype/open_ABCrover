# Overview
This is an open source, affordable ground platform for remote-operated & autonomous driving experiments.
It is :  
* Simple and Expandable
    * Main chassis made of aluminum extruded beam
    * Cheap and easy-to-by electronics
    * 3D printed brackets and mounts easy to be customized
  
* All terrain driving
    * High power motor and big wheel
    * Moderate size for indoor use, same foot print as domestic robotic vacuums
    * Convertible brackets to boost up wheel base and tread width for stable outdoor locomotion
